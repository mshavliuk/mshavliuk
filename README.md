### Hey, what's up ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend WEB developer at [@planbrothers](https://github.com/planbrothers), mostly specialized in [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript), [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular), [NgRx](https://github.com/ngrx) etc. In my spare time, I'm rather a language-agnostic problem solver (or creator?).

There is plenty of things that I'm interested in, such as machine learning, cybersecurity, and microcontrollers, but I can't find enough time for it, so I like to pretend that I know nothing about it ðŸ™ˆ

If you found one of my repositories useful and want to encourage me to further accomplishments, feel free to send me some [BAT tokens](https://basicattentiontoken.org/about/) or a bug report ðŸ˜‰

You can reach me via [Email ðŸ“«](mailto:mikhail.shavliuk@ya.ru)
